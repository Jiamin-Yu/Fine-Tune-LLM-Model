# Fine-Tune-LLM-Model
Use JSONL to fine-tune OpenAI Models

In this project, I fine-tune OpenAI's 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14' model to make its outputs more truthful: after fine-tuning, the model will be less likely to make up answers, and it will simply answer 'I don't know' for answers that it is not sure about.

#User Guide
If you want to run the project, you should change the API key to your own OpenAI API key, and then you can run it.
